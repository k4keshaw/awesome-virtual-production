## Overview
### What is Virtual Production
> Virtual production tends to be used to help visualize complex scenes or scenes that simply cannot be filmed for real. In general, though, virtual production can really refer to any techniques that allow filmmakers to plan, imagine, or complete some kind of filmic element, typically with the aid of digital tools. Previs, techvis, postvis, motion capture, vr, ar, simul-cams, virtual cameras, and real-time rendering ‚Äì and combinations of these ‚Äì are all terms now synonymous with virtual production.

### Why Unreal Engine
>#### Immediate feedback, without the wait
>With real-time rendering that enables creatives to receive immediate feedback on their work and make changes on the fly, shot production is no longer a waiting game. In Unreal Engine‚Äôs collaborative creative environment, your entire crew can share ideas visually, iterate quickly, and make decisions with confidence.
>#### End-to-end production efficiencies
>From earliest concept to finished frames, Unreal Engine workflows provide the flexibility to reuse the same set of optimized assets through every phase of production, eliminating time-consuming and costly rework. You can even use the same assets for interactive and location-based entertainment, marketing materials, and more.
>#### And it's completely free
